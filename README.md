# Ray Tracing Image Renderer (x86)

## Introduction
This x86-based ray tracing image renderer replicates OpenGL rendering directions and uses the Blinn-Phong lighting model. It's designed for detailed light simulation and texture effects in a minimalistic 3D scene.

## Key Features
- **Blinn-Phong Lighting Model**: Ambient, diffuse, specular lighting from multiple sources.
- **Specular Reflections & Realistic Shadows**: Mirror-like reflections and shadow rendering.
- **Texture Mapping**: Enhances visual details.
- **Additional Shapes**: Inclusion of complex geometries like tetrahedrons, pyramids, etc.
- **Optional Anti-aliasing & Soft Shadows**: For smoother image quality.

## Installation
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/aiyufan3/Recursive-ray-renderer.git]
cd [Recursive ray renderer]
# Follow additional setup instructions

## Usage
Detailed guide on initializing and configuring the renderer, including light and texture settings.
